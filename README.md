#Project 1 - Daily Dashboard

###What is it? 

* Display of all the information you would want to see on a daily basis.  
* Such as: email, FaceBook, Twitter, Calendar, websites, etc. 
* A *dashboard* that changes the way you interact with all these different types & also sources of information
* This information should change daily, if not more.

###Who uses this concept? 
* Military Heads up Display (HUD) in plane
* Your car dashboard
* The great [Panic Software Co.](http://www.panic.com/blog/2010/03/the-panic-status-board/) to show project status

* Receive feedback using InVision app 
* Design a prototype first with JetStrap utilizing the Twitter Bootstrap
* Then finalize with a visual design, and semi-working prototype
